## F5 BIG-IP Azure ARM Templates 2.0


## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository for F5's ARM Templates V2 for Azure deployments. All of the templates in this repository have been developed by F5 Networks engineers. This repository contains one main directory: *examples*.

- **examples**<br>
  These are our next-generation Cloud Solutions Templates 2.0 (CST2) which have been designed to provide an improved user experience with fewer templates, simplified deployments, customization via a new modular nested/linked architecture, and more. The example templates in this directory have been tested and verified to work as-is and are intended to provide reference deployments of F5 BIG-IP Virtual Editions. 

## Template information

Descriptions for each template are contained at the top of each template in the *Description* key.
For additional information, including how the templates are generated or assistance in deploying a template, see the README.md file in the individual template directory.

To get started, first checkout the /examples folder.

## Getting Help

Due to the heavy customization requirements of external cloud resources and BIG-IP configurations in these solutions, F5 does not provide technical support for deploying, customizing, or troubleshooting the templates themselves. However, the various underlying products and components used (for example: [F5 BIG-IP Virtual Edition](https://clouddocs.f5.com/cloud/public/v1/), [F5 BIG-IP Runtime Init](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-bigip-runtime-init), [F5 Automation Toolchain](https://www.f5.com/pdf/products/automation-toolchain-overview.pdf) extensions, and [Cloud Failover Extension (CFE)](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-cloud-failover/latest/)) in the solutions located here are F5-supported and capable of being deployed with other orchestration tools. Problems found with the templates deployed as-is should be reported with a GitHub issue. Read more about [Support Policies](https://www.f5.com/company/policies/support-policies).


For help with authoring and support for custom CST2 templates, we recommend engaging F5 Professional Services (PS).
