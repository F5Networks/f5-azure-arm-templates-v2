## Support Information

- Due to the heavy customization requirements of external cloud resources and BIG-IP configurations in these solutions, F5 cannot provide technical support for deploying, customizing, or troubleshooting the templates themselves.
- Issues found with the templates deployed as-is should be reported via a GitHub issue.
- The various underlying products and components used in the solutions located here are F5-supported (for example: F5 BIG-IP Virtual Edition, F5 BIG-IP Runtime Init, Automation Toolchain extensions, and Cloud Failover Extension (CFE)).
- For help with authoring & support for custom CST2 templates, we recommend engaging F5 Professional Services (PS).
